# Your Personal Portfolio
[My Website](https://kev-portfolio-kev107034011s-projects.vercel.app/)

This is an interactive 3D portfolio to effectively introduce yourself and showcase the programming skills. With the dynamic structure within template code, users can fork this repo and customize their own portfolio.

<strong> Featured language & framework: #React.js #Tailwind CSS #JavaScript #Three.js #React Three Fiber </strong>

In general, the repo was referred to this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt0FrkQgw8w) with some customizations to conclude more information and preferred style. 

E.g., Scrollable Job Experience, Educational Background, Rotating Globe with Pin, etc.

For deployment portion, since it's a static page, I endorse Vercel for free hosting & domain.

Please feel free to fork & create your own personal portfolio now! :)
